Bidirectional Object Counter System
Project description

Purpose: In this project , we will make a bidirectional Visitor Counter with an Automatic Light Control System using Arduino . This project is based on a pair of infrared sensors that detects interrupt when it detects an obstacle. The pair of IR sensors can detect the visitor from both directions, i.e. the number of entering visitors and the number of exiting visitors. 

This ArduinoBidirectional Visitor Counter Project can be used to count the number of persons entering a hall, Shopping mall, office, functions in the entrance gate. It can also be used at gates of parking areas and other public places. The device counts the total number of people entering through the gate and also the total number of people leaving through the same gate. And finally, it counts the total number of people currently present inside the room. When no people are inside the room, i.e. the total number of people is zero then the room light is turned off . When even a single person is found inside the room, the light turns on . The light control system is automatic based on the visitor's presence.
